<b>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a young discipline of sixty years, which is a set of sciences, theories and techniques (including mathematical logic, statistics, probabilities, computational neurobiology, computer science) that aims to imitate the cognitive abilities of a human being. Initiated in the breath of the Second World War, its developments are intimately linked to those of computing and have led computers to perform increasingly complex tasks, which could previously only be delegated to a human.

However, this automation remains far from human intelligence in the strict sense, which makes the name open to criticism by some experts. The ultimate stage of their research (a "strong" AI, i.e. the ability to contextualize very different specialized problems in a totally autonomous way) is absolutely not comparable to current achievements ("weak" or "moderate" AIs, extremely efficient in their training field). The "strong" AI, which has only yet materialized in science fiction, would require advances in basic research (not just performance improvements) to be able to model the world as a whole.



Since 2010, however, the discipline has experienced a new boom, mainly due to the considerable improvement in the computing power of computers and access to massive quantities of data.

Promises, renewed, and concerns, sometimes fantasized, complicate an objective understanding of the phenomenon. Brief historical reminders can help to situate the discipline and inform current debates</b>
<h2>Birth of AI in the wake of cybernetics</h2>
<B>The period somewhere in the range of 1940 and 1960 was emphatically set apart by the combination of mechanical turns of events (of which the Second World War was a quickening agent) and the craving to see how to unite the working of machines and natural creatures. For Norbert Wiener, a pioneer in computer science, the point was to bring together numerical hypothesis, gadgets and mechanization as "an entire hypothesis of control and correspondence, both in creatures and machines". Not long previously, a first scientific and PC model of the natural neuron (formal neuron) had been created by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts as right on time as 1943. 

Toward the start of 1950, John Von Neumann and Alan Turing didn't make the term AI however were the establishing fathers of the innovation behind it: they made the change from PCs to nineteenth century decimal rationale (which consequently managed qualities from 0 to 9) and machines to twofold rationale (which depend on Boolean variable based math, managing pretty much significant chains of 0 or 1). The two specialists in this manner formalized the design of our contemporary PCs and exhibited that it was a general machine, fit for executing what is modified. Turing, then again, brought up the issue of the conceivable knowledge of a machine without precedent for his well known 1950 article "Figuring Machinery and Intelligence" and depicted a "round of impersonation", where a human ought to have the option to recognize in a print discourse whether he is conversing with a man or a machine. Anyway disputable this article might be (this "Turing test" doesn't seem to fit the bill for some specialists), it will frequently be refered to as being at the wellspring of the scrutinizing of the limit between the human and the machine. 

The expression "simulated intelligence" could be ascribed to John McCarthy of MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), which Marvin Minsky (Carnegie-Mellon University) characterizes as "the development of PC programs that take part in errands that are as of now more acceptably performed by people since they require significant level mental procedures, for example, perceptual learning, memory association and basic thinking. The late spring 1956 meeting at Dartmouth College (supported by the Rockefeller Institute) is viewed as the originator of the order. Episodically, it is important the extraordinary accomplishment of what was not a gathering but instead a workshop. Just six individuals, including McCarthy and Minsky, had remained reliably present all through this work (which depended basically on improvements dependent on formal rationale). 

While innovation stayed interesting and promising (see, for instance, the 1963 article by Reed C. Lawlor, an individual from the California Bar, entitled "What Computers Can Do: Analysis and Prediction of Judicial Decisions"), the ubiquity of innovation fell back in the mid 1960s. The machines had next to no memory, making it hard to utilize a coding languages. In any case, there were at that point a few establishments despite everything present today, for example, the arrangement trees to tackle issues: the IPL, data preparing language, had in this manner made it conceivable to compose as right on time as 1956 the LTM (rationale scholar machine) program which expected to exhibit numerical hypotheses. 

Herbert Simon, financial specialist and social scientist, forecasted in 1957 that the AI would prevail with regards to beating a human at chess in the following 10 years, yet the AI at that point entered a first winter. Simon's vision end up being correct... 30 years later</b>
<h2>1980-1990:Experts System</h2>
<b>In 1968 Stanley Kubrick coordinated the film "2001 Space Odyssey" where a PC - HAL 9000 (just one letter away from those of IBM) sums up in itself the entire total of moral inquiries presented by AI: will it speak to a significant level of advancement, a useful for humankind or a risk? The effect of the film will normally not be logical yet it will add to promote the topic, similarly as the sci-fi creator Philip K. Dick, who will never stop to think about whether, at some point, the machines will encounter feelings. 

It was with the approach of the primary microchips toward the finish of 1970 that AI took off again and entered the brilliant period of master frameworks. 

The way was really opened at MIT in 1965 with DENDRAL (master framework represented considerable authority in atomic science) and at Stanford University in 1972 with MYCIN (framework had practical experience in the determination of blood sicknesses and physician endorsed drugs). These frameworks depended on a "deduction motor," which was modified to be a coherent reflection of human thinking. By entering information, the motor gave answers of an elevated level of skill. 

The guarantees predicted a gigantic turn of events however the fever will fall again toward the finish of 1980, mid 1990. The programming of such information really required a great deal of exertion and from 200 to 300 guidelines, there was a "discovery" impact where it was not satisfactory how the machine contemplated. Advancement and upkeep hence turned out to be incredibly hazardous and - most importantly - quicker and in numerous different less mind boggling and more affordable ways were conceivable. It ought to be reviewed that during the 1990s, the term computerized reasoning had nearly become no-no and progressively unobtrusive varieties had even entered college language, for example, "propelled figuring". 

The achievement in May 1997 of Deep Blue (IBM's master framework) at the chess game against Garry Kasparov satisfied Herbert Simon's 1957 prediction 30 years after the fact yet didn't bolster the financing and advancement of this type of AI. The activity of Deep Blue depended on a precise savage power calculation, where every single imaginable move were assessed and weighted. The destruction of the human stayed extremely representative in the history however Deep Blue had as a general rule just figured out how to treat an exceptionally constrained border (that of the standards of the chess game), extremely distant from the ability to show the multifaceted nature of the world.</b>
<h2>Since 2010: a new bloom based on massive data and new computing power</h2>
<b>Two variables clarify the new blast in the control around 2010. 

- First of all, entrance to huge volumes of information. To have the option to utilize calculations for picture order and feline acknowledgment, for instance, it was already important to complete examining yourself. Today, a basic hunt on Google can discover millions. 

- Then the revelation of the extremely high effectiveness of PC illustrations card processors to quicken the figuring of learning calculations. The procedure being extremely iterative, it could take a long time before 2010 to process the whole example. The processing intensity of these cards (prepared to do in excess of a thousand billion exchanges for every second) has empowered significant advancement at a constrained budgetary cost (under 1000 euros for each card). 

This new mechanical hardware has empowered some huge open victories and has supported subsidizing: in 2011, Watson, IBM's IA, will win the games against 2 Jeopardy champions! Â». In 2012, Google X (Google's pursuit lab) will have the option to have an AI perceive felines on a video. In excess of 16,000 processors have been utilized for this last undertaking, however the potential is unprecedented: a machine figures out how to recognize something. In 2016, AlphaGO (Google's AI had some expertise in Go games) will beat the European victor (Fan Hui) and the best on the planet (Lee Sedol) at that point herself (AlphaGo Zero). Let us indicate that the round of Go has a combinatorics considerably more significant than chess (more than the quantity of particles known to man) and that it is preposterous to expect to have such critical outcomes in crude quality (with respect to Deep Blue in 1997). 

Where did this marvel originate from? A total change in perspective from master frameworks. The methodology has gotten inductive: it is not, at this point an issue of coding rules with respect to master frameworks, however of letting PCs find only them by relationship and arrangement, based on an enormous measure of information. 

Among AI strategies, profound learning appears the most encouraging for various applications (counting voice or picture acknowledgment). In 2003, Geoffrey Hinton (University of Toronto), Yoshua Bengio (University of Montreal) and Yann LeCun (University of New York) chose to begin an exploration program to bring neural systems state-of-the-art. Examinations led at the same time at Microsoft, Google and IBM with the assistance of the Toronto research center in Hinton indicated that this kind of learning prevailing with regards to splitting the mistake rates for discourse acknowledgment. Comparable outcomes were accomplished by Hinton's picture acknowledgment group. 

Overnight, a vast greater part of research groups went to this innovation with undeniable advantages. This kind of learning has additionally empowered extensive advancement in content acknowledgment, in any case, as indicated by specialists like Yann LeCun, there is as yet far to go to create content getting frameworks. Conversational specialists outline this test well: our cell phones definitely realize how to interpret a guidance yet can't completely contextualize it and dissect our expectations.</b>
